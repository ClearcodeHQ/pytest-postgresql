Testing
-------

# Tests are written using pytest.
# PR tests run on Github Actions.
# In order to run the tests locally you need to have one version of postgres installed. And pass envvar named `POSTGRES` with used version number
# If you encounter any test failures due to locale issues, make sure that both `en_US.UTF-8` and `de_DE.UTF-8` are enabled in `/etc/locale.gen` and then run `sudo locale-gen`.
