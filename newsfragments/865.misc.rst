Fix DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version.

`datetime.datetime.utcnow` has been deprecated by Python and will soon be removed by Python 3.14 (see warning text below)

The following warning used to pop up everytime someone with a recent version of Python (3.12+) uses this plugin

.. code-block::

    .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pytest_postgresql/retry.py:22: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version. Use timezone-aware objects to represent datetimes in UTC: datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC).
        time: datetime = datetime.utcnow()
