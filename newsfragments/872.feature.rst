When running tests with xdist, pytest-postgresql now attempts to detect random ports
selected by other nodes by writing down a .port file in session temporary directory.

The number of tries it attempts to select unused port is configurable,
and defaults to 0.

In case pytest-postgresql won't be able to select unused port,
PortForException is thrown with appropriate message.
